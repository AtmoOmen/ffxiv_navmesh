- walk/fly transitions
- better pathfind
-- use same string-pulling idea for navvolumes
-- follow/target update
- improve nearest search for blocked voxels to prefer voxels on correct side
- improve debug rendering
-- soft fail
-- get rid of gs
-- use simple mesh for quad/box
- per-zone custom markup (tighter borders? shapes to ignore?)
- optimize voxelization - just rewrite this shit and add unittest to compare with recast
- volume nav - consider building equivalent of navmesh
-- do we even need any compact representation? connectivity sounds hard for 3d spans...
-- watershed-like partitioning - should be easy
-- contour tracing - moderate?
-- contour simplification - easy
-- building simple polys - moderate?
-- earcut triangulation - easy?
-- theta* on mesh - easy?
- jump / drop markup (offmesh connections?)
- area transitions & high-level zone graph

- volume map refactor:
