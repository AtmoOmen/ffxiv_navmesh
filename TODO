- figure out max-slope used by game (hook raycasts and see how it is called)
- figure out max-climb and ch (max-climb should be 0.5wu, do we need an extra voxel?)
- draw geometry with per-triangle coloring by maxclimb threshold
- figure out fly bounds (0x2021 material planes)
- optimize voxelization
-- just rewrite this shit and add unittest to compare with recast
- volume nav:
-- configurable voxelmap resolution
-- optimize memory used by voxelmap pathfind query
-- consider building equivalent of navmesh
--- do we even need any compact representation? connectivity sounds hard for 3d spans...
--- watershed-like partitioning - should be easy
--- contour tracing - moderate?
--- contour simplification - easy
--- building simple polys - moderate?
--- earcut triangulation - easy?
--- theta* on mesh - easy?
- walk/fly transitions
- on-the-fly update navmesh tiles near player to account for loose geometry streaming
- jump / drop markup (offmesh connections?)
- navmesh caching
- area transitions & high-level zone graph
- memory usage
